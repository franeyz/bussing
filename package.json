Users can keep track of their\r frequently used routes and bus stops, and updates for these routes will be displayed with a \r higher priority than the other messages. Users can also enter a start and end destination with\r departure/arrival times, and Better Bussing will find show which bus route to take, if any (not sure about this yet).",
